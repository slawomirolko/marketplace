# Obsidian Plugin & Theme Best Practices

This skill outlines crucial patterns, common pitfalls, and effective debugging strategies for developing within the Obsidian ecosystem.

## 1. Safety and Null Checking

When interacting with Obsidian's APIs—especially internal or undocumented ones—defensive programming is mandatory.

- **Internal API Gracefulness**: Never assume `app.internalPlugins` or sub-plugins are fully loaded or exist, as this will crash the plugin load sequence.

  ```javascript
  // Bad: will crash if workspaces plugin is disabled or loading
  const ws = app.internalPlugins.plugins.workspaces.instance.activeWorkspace;

  // Good: safely traverse the object
  const ws =
    app.internalPlugins?.plugins?.workspaces?.instance?.activeWorkspace || "";
  ```

- **File Access Verification**: If your plugin binds to events that deal with a current file, but the active file event returns null/undefined, gracefully fall back by checking `app.workspace.getActiveFile()`.

- **Regex and Document Parsing**: If you are doing manual scrapes of the DOM (like checking `document.title` for version strings), always verify `.match()` returns an array before accessing properties like `.length`.

## 2. Editor & CodeMirror 6 (Live Preview)

In Obsidian's "Live Preview" mode, standard HTML elements (like `<a>` tags with `href` attributes) are often replaced by CodeMirror 6 widgets. For example, a Markdown link `[text](url)` might render as a series of spans (`.cm-link`, `.cm-url`) in the DOM, but the `.cm-url` span may be completely empty of text and lack an `href` attribute.

- **Extracting Data under the Cursor/Mouse**: Never rely solely on DOM attributes (`element.href` or `element.innerText`) when hovering over editor content. Instead, convert the mouse coordinates to a CodeMirror document position, and read the raw Markdown text from the editor state:

  ```javascript
  // 1. Get the CodeMirror EditorView instance
  const leaf = this.app.workspace.getMostRecentLeaf();
  const cmView = leaf?.view?.editor?.cm;
  if (!cmView) return;

  // 2. Convert mouse event coordinates to a document position
  const pos = cmView.posAtCoords({ x: event.clientX, y: event.clientY });
  if (pos === null) return;

  // 3. Extract the surrounding line text from the document state
  const lineStart = cmView.state.doc.lineAt(pos).from;
  const lineEnd = cmView.state.doc.lineAt(pos).to;
  const lineText = cmView.state.doc.sliceString(lineStart, lineEnd);
  
  // 4. Parse the lineText (e.g., with regex) to find the actual URL or markdown token
  ```

## 2. Plugin Structure & Installation

- **manifest.json Versioning**: All plugins _must_ declare a `minAppVersion` in their `manifest.json`. Without this, modern versions of Obsidian will reject the plugin and it will fail to enable.
  ```json
  {
    "id": "my-plugin",
    "name": "My Plugin",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "minAppVersion": "0.15.0"
  }
  ```

- **Manual Installation Naming**: When cloning or manually placing a plugin folder into `.obsidian/plugins/`, the directory name exactly must match the `id` string inside its `manifest.json`. If they do not match, Obsidian will silently fail to recognize the plugin. (e.g., if `id: "bases-kanban"`, the folder cannot be named `obsidian-bases-kanban`).

- **First-Time Loading**: If you manually install a new plugin, `obsidian plugin:reload id=<plugin-id>` will return a "Plugin not found" error because the plugin is not yet indexed by the app. You must first ensure it is added to `community-plugins.json`, and then run a full `obsidian reload` to restart the vault environment.

## 3. UI and Window Overrides

- **Emptying Titles / Hiding Text**: If you are overriding native Obsidian text structures (like the application window title) to be entirely blank, a simple empty space (`" "`) is rarely sufficient. Obsidian's core engine often strips pure whitespace and reverts to its default backup text (like the standard Vault + Filename title).
  - **Solution**: Inject a **Zero-Width Space** (`\u200B`). This safely tricks the application into rendering a purely blank element that Obsidian respiects as "contentful text".

## 4. The CLI Debugging Workflow

If developing plugins, you do not need to rely on the physical inspector window inside Obsidian. Leverage the `obsidian-cli` (installed globally):

- **Fast Iteration Loop**: Avoid manually toggling plugins in the settings. Chain your build logic with the CLI reload to instantly reflect code changes:
  ```bash
  npm run build && obsidian plugin:reload id=<your-plugin-id>
  ```
- **Error Hunting**: If a plugin fails to load quietly, or crashes silently, stream the errors directly to your terminal:
  ```bash
  obsidian dev:errors
  ```
- **Live Context Execution**: Check the state of the app without needing `console.log` trace logs. Execute code directly:
  ```bash
  obsidian eval code="app.plugins.enabledPlugins.has('my-plugin')"
  ```
- **Live Memory & View Inspection**: When visual bugs or silent state failures occur without explicit console errors (e.g., a card failing to snap into a new kanban column), use `obsidian eval code="..."` to traverse the live component UI tree. For example, looking into `app.workspace.getLeavesOfType('view-type')[0].view...` allows you to inspect deep configuration settings and runtime variables powering active workspace views in real-time.

## 5. UI Elements Customization

When creating DOM elements for a plugin (like file trees or recent file views), adhering to the following ensures it feels like native Obsidian UI:

- **Avoiding Hover "Jumpiness"**: Place dynamic, on-hover UI actions (like delete 'x' buttons) carefully. Instead of transitioning from `display: none` to `display: flex` (which shifts other elements and causes visual jumpiness), use `visibility: hidden` and `visibility: visible` to preserve layout size. If the element should overlap or appear precisely in a corner, leverage `position: absolute` so it falls out of the document flow and prevents reflowing the flex/grid parents.

- **Grid for Multi-Line Items**: If a list item needs to stack information (e.g., a file name on top, a parent folder path below), `display: grid` is often superior to flexbox. By defining `grid-template-columns` and `grid-template-rows` (with the bottom text set to `grid-column: 1 / -1; grid-row: 2;`), you guarantee exact alignment between the parent and children without messy left margins.

- **Native CSS Variables**: Never hardcode colors, fonts, or cursors unless strictly necessary. Utilize Obsidian's built-in CSS variables for seamless theme compatibility:
  - Text colors: `var(--text-normal)`, `var(--text-muted)`, `var(--text-faint)`
  - Fonts: `var(--font-smallest)`, `var(--font-smaller)`
  - Interactions: `var(--nav-item-color-hover)`, `var(--cursor)`

- **Icon Alignments**: When embedding SVGs next to text, use relative `em` units instead of absolute pixels (e.g., `width: 0.85em; height: 0.85em`) combined with `vertical-align: middle` or a clean `align-items: center` flex wrapper to keep the icon exactly vertically aligned with the adjacent text.

- **Nav/Tree Structure**: When building sidebars (like file explorers), try to match or mimic the HTML structure Obsidian uses for its native sidebars. If using custom DOM elements, recreate the flex-grow structure carefully so that elements fill horizontal space appropriately (e.g., `.tree-item-spacer { flex-grow: 1; }`).
