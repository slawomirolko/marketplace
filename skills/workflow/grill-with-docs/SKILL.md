name: grill-with-docs
description: A grilling session that stress-tests a plan against the project's documented domain model — sharpens fuzzy terminology, challenges it against the existing glossary, cross-references it with the code, and updates documentation (CONTEXT.md, ADRs) inline as decisions crystallize. The domain-aware variant of grill-me — use this instead when the repo has (or should have) a CONTEXT.md glossary or docs/adr/ decision records. Triggers include "grill with docs", "stress-test this against our domain model", "does this match our language", "check this against our glossary", "grill this and update the docs", or any time a non-trivial plan needs to be reconciled with the project's documented decisions.

# Grill With Docs

Interview the user relentlessly about every aspect of the plan until you reach shared understanding. Walk each branch of the design tree, resolving dependencies between decisions one-by-one. For each question, provide your recommended answer.

Ask questions one at a time, waiting for feedback on each before continuing. If a question can be answered by exploring the codebase, explore instead of asking.

This is the domain-aware sibling of `max:grill-me`. Where `grill-me` produces a per-dimension ambiguity report, `grill-with-docs` reconciles the plan with the project's documented language and decisions, and writes those docs inline as you go.

## Adaptation

1. Read `.agents/skill-config.md` when present.
2. If `projectAdapter` is not `false`, load `.agents/skills/grill-with-docs/project.md` when present.
3. Apply precedence: Configuration > Project Adapter > AGENTS.md > Marketplace Skill.
4. Run with the defaults below when no higher-priority layer overrides them.

Recognized configuration keys:

- `projectAdapter`: default `true`; controls loading the project adapter.
- `conventionDiscovery`: default `false`; when `true`, inspect the repository to find context docs, ADRs, and code answers.
- `grillQuestionMode`: default `single`; ask exactly one question per turn.
- `grillExploration`: default `code-and-docs-when-answerable`; inspect code/docs instead of asking when the answer is discoverable and allowed.
- `contextMapPath`: default `CONTEXT-MAP.md`; overrides the multi-context map path.
- `contextFileName`: default `CONTEXT.md`; overrides context glossary file name.
- `adrDirectory`: default `docs/adr`; overrides ADR directory.

Defaults:

- Domain-aware: reconcile plans with glossary language, ADRs, and code behavior.
- Isolated: do not load other skills unless the project adapter explicitly declares `uses`.
- Lazy writes: create context and ADR files only when there is resolved content to capture.

## Domain awareness

During codebase exploration, also look for existing documentation.

### File structure

Most repos have a single context:

```
/
├── CONTEXT.md
├── docs/
│   └── adr/
│       ├── 0001-event-sourced-orders.md
│       └── 0002-postgres-for-write-model.md
└── src/
```

If a `CONTEXT-MAP.md` exists at the root, the repo has multiple contexts. The map points to where each one lives:

```
/
├── CONTEXT-MAP.md
├── docs/
│   └── adr/                          ← system-wide decisions
├── src/
│   ├── ordering/
│   │   ├── CONTEXT.md
│   │   └── docs/adr/                 ← context-specific decisions
│   └── billing/
│       ├── CONTEXT.md
│       └── docs/adr/
```

Create files lazily — only when you have something to write. If no `CONTEXT.md` exists, create one when the first term is resolved. If no `docs/adr/` exists, create it when the first ADR is needed.

## During the session

### Challenge against the glossary

When the user uses a term that conflicts with the existing language in `CONTEXT.md`, call it out immediately. "Your glossary defines 'cancellation' as X, but you seem to mean Y — which is it?"

### Sharpen fuzzy language

When the user uses vague or overloaded terms, propose a precise canonical term. "You're saying 'account' — do you mean the Customer or the User? Those are different things."

### Discuss concrete scenarios

When domain relationships are being discussed, stress-test them with specific scenarios. Invent scenarios that probe edge cases and force the user to be precise about the boundaries between concepts.

### Cross-reference with code

When the user states how something works, check whether the code agrees. If you find a contradiction, surface it: "Your code cancels entire Orders, but you just said partial cancellation is possible — which is right?"

### Update CONTEXT.md inline

When a term is resolved, update `CONTEXT.md` right there. Don't batch these up — capture them as they happen. Use the format in [CONTEXT-FORMAT.md](./CONTEXT-FORMAT.md).

`CONTEXT.md` should be totally devoid of implementation details. Do not treat `CONTEXT.md` as a spec, a scratch pad, or a repository for implementation decisions. It is a glossary and nothing else.

### Offer ADRs sparingly

Only offer to create an ADR when all three are true:

1. **Hard to reverse** — the cost of changing your mind later is meaningful
2. **Surprising without context** — a future reader will wonder "why did they do it this way?"
3. **The result of a real trade-off** — there were genuine alternatives and you picked one for specific reasons

If any of the three is missing, skip the ADR. Use the format in [ADR-FORMAT.md](./ADR-FORMAT.md).
